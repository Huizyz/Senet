<h1>How to play Senet</h1>

<p>
    <b>Goal:</b><br>
    Be the first player to move all 5 of the tokens in your player color (black or white) off of the
    end of the game board. The game ends when one player has successfully passed square
    30, the “House of Horus,” with each of their five tokens, removing them from the game
    board.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Setup:</b><br>
    All the colored tokens get placed on squares 1–10, with the white tokens on the odd-numbered
    squares and the dark tokens on the even-numbered squares.
</p>
<p>
    <b>How the player moves:</b><br>
    Toss the wooden throwing sticks. The number of light sides that land facing up is the
    number of spaces a player moves one of their tokens. Only one token may be moved per
    turn.
</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Toss 1 light stick, and you move one token one space and get to toss again.</li>
    <li>Toss 2 light sticks, and you move one token two spaces.</li>
    <li>Toss 3 light sticks, and you move one token three spaces.</li>
    <li>Toss 4 light sticks, and you move one token four spaces and get to toss again.</li>
    <li>Toss 0 light sticks, and you move one token five spaces and get to toss again.</li>
    </ul>
<p>Tokens move along the board in a reverse “S” shape, following the order of the numbers.</p>
<p><b>To Begin:</b><br>
    To determine who goes first, toss the throwing sticks. The first player to throw a “1” plays
    with the dark tokens; players may need to toss the sticks multiple times until one of them
    has thrown a “1.” That player moves their dark token from square 10 to square 11 and gets
    to toss again, and this time may select any of their dark tokens to move.
    The second player can toss any number to begin moving their light-colored tokens, but
    must move the token that starts on square 9 first.</p>
<p><b>Gameplay:</b><br></p>
<ol>
    <li>Only a single token can occupy a space on the board. If your token ends its move on
        the same space as one of your opponent’s tokens, send your opponent’s token back
        to the space your token occupied at the start of its movement. You cannot land on a
        space occupied by one of your own tokens.</li>
    <li>If two tokens of the same color are on consecutive squares (for example, squares 17
        and 18), neither token can be displaced by an opponent landing on the same space.
        This also works for squares around the corner from each other, such as squares 20 and
        21, but not on spaces across from each other, such as squares 18 and 23.</li>
    <li>On your turn, you must try to move forward. If you cannot, you must move a token
        backwards instead, and you lose any extra turns you may have thrown. If after tossing
        the sticks you have no valid moves, your turn ends immediately.</li>
    <li>If your token ends its move on square 15, the House of Second Life, immediately place
        that token on square 1 at the start of the game board. </li>
    <li>The last 5 squares of the game are special. On the last 4 squares, tokens do not protect
        each other as described in rule 2, above.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
    <li>Square 26: The House of Beauty. No token may proceed past this square until it
        has first landed here as the result of an exact throw. </li>
    <li>Square 27: The House of Waters. If a token lands here, you lose any additional turns
        you gained from your throw. On your next turn, you must deal with this token. You
        have two options. </li>
    <li style="margin-left: 25px">Option one: You can choose to return your token to square 15, the House of
        Second Life, and end your turn without throwing. </li>
    <li style="margin-left: 25px">Option two: You can toss the throwing sticks. If you throw a “4,” your token
        leaves the House of Waters; you successfully remove the token from the
        board, and gain an extra turn. If you do not throw a “4,” the token remains in
        the House of Waters, and your turn ends immediately</li>
    <li>Square 28: The House of Three Judges. Your token cannot move from this space
        until you toss an exact throw of “3.”</li>
    <li>Square 29: The House of Two Judges. Your token cannot move from this space
        until you toss an exact throw of “2.”</li>
    <li>Square 30. The House of Horus. You can successfully remove your token from the
        board with a throw of “1” or greater. </li>
</ul>
