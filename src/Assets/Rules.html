<h1>How to play Senet</h1>

<p>
    <b>Goal:</b><br>
    Be the first player to move all 5 of the tokens in your player color (white) off of the
    end of the game board. The game ends when one player has successfully passed square
    30, the “House of Horus,” with each of their five tokens, removing them from the game
    board.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Setup:</b><br>
    All the colored tokens get placed on squares 1–10, with the white tokens on the odd-numbered
    squares and the dark tokens on the even-numbered squares.
</p>
<p>
    <b>How the player moves:</b><br>

    Toss the throwing sticks. The number of light sides that land facing up is the
    number of spaces a player moves one of their tokens. Only one token may be moved per
    turn.
</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Toss 1 light stick, you move one token one space and get to toss again.</li>
    <li>Toss 2 light sticks, you move one token two spaces.</li>
    <li>Toss 3 light sticks, you move one token three spaces.</li>
    <li>Toss 4 light sticks, you move one token four spaces and get to toss again.</li>
    <li>Toss 0 light sticks, you move one token five spaces and get to toss again.</li>
    </ul>
<p>Tokens move along the board from left to right, following the order of the numbers.</p>
<p><b>Who Plays First:</b><br>
    The player decides to start first, let the Computer go first or have it select for them.</p>
<p><b>Gameplay:</b><br></p>
<ol>
    <li>Only a single token can occupy a space on the board. If your token moves onto
        the same space as one of your opponent’s tokens, send your opponent’s token back
        to the space your token occupied at the start of its movement. You cannot land on a
        space occupied by one of your own tokens.</li>
    <li>If two tokens of the same color are on consecutive squares, neither token can be displaced by an opponent landing on the same space.</li>
    <li>On your turn, you must try to move forward. If you cannot, you must move a token
        backwards instead, and you lose any extra turns you may have thrown.</li>
    <li>Three enemy pieces on consecutive squares may not be passed by the opponent.</li>
    <li>On square 25 a piece is protected, even if it is alone.</li>
    <li>On squares 27, 28 and 29 your pieces are never protected. If you move backward from one of those squares you will return to the 15th square.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
    <li>Square 26: The House of Waters. If a token lands here, you have to go back to House 15. </li>
    <li>Square 27: Must throw a 3 to exit.</li>
    <li>Square 28: Must throw a 2 to exit.</li>
    <li>Square 29. Must throw a 1 to exit.</li>
</ul>
